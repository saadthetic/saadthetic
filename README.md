## 🌟 About Me

My aim is to become a member of a dynamic syndicate. Where I can actively learn and enhance my skills in the realm of technology. I spend time sharing my knowledge and skills, so I can sharpen myself and learn more and more !!

My journey as an engineer and developer has been anything but linear, and that's my greatest strength. I started with a deep dive into embedded systems and IoT, which gave me a fundamental understanding of how technology interacts with the physical world. I then expanded into full-stack web and native development in modern languages, building the applications and user experiences that bring those systems to life. My dedication to ethical hacking and cybersecurity ensures that everything I build is secure and reliable.
This unique fusion of skills allows me to act as a technical all-rounder, crafting comprehensive solutions that span from code to digital commerce.
